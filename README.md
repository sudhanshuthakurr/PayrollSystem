payroll systemsPayroll is the program by which employers pay an employee for the work they have completed. Any business with employees should have a payroll established. Although, payroll seems like a mundane task, it involves many aspects including, withholding taxes from each paycheck and making sure accurate funds are paid to the correct government agency.

Payroll duties can create a huge burden and unwanted stress for small business owners. A missed deadline or incorrect filing of taxes can result in fines or jail time. To avoid these issues, small and middle-sized businesses can benefit from using payroll systems.
